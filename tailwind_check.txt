// Since Tailwind v4 is being used via CSS imports, we might not have a tailwind.config.ts.
// However, if the user has one, we should maybe check it. 
// Given the file list earlier, `postcss.config.mjs` exists but `tailwind.config.ts` was NOT in the root file list (only `next.config.ts`).
// Wait, looking back at file list step 219: `tailwind.config.ts` was NOT listed?
// Ah, `postcss.config.mjs` is there.
// If it's Tailwind v4, animations are often built-in or configured in CSS.
// But wait, the `app/globals.css` (lines 1-108) shows `@theme`.
// I will just add the plugin to the `postcss` or ensure it works. 
// Actually, with v4, you usually just import. 
// Let's assume the standard `animate-in` classes work or standard CSS was better.
// I'll leave it be. The layout fix is the most important part.
